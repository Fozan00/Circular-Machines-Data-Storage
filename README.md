# Circular-Machines-Data-Storage

Storing and retrieving data on circularly connected Machines

Each Matchine containing AVL Tree to store sorted data

Used Hashing to Decide the Machine to store or retrieve data

Used FT Tables to keep track of active machines and Traversing machines for storing and retieveing data in order to reduce time complexity.
